# 1. Working with assigning simple string, number, array types was fairly easy. Type inference, interfaces, and unions seems like it would be useful so that you wouldn't have to repeat yourself .

# 2. Had some issues with typescript working when using the npx tsc with - command. Generics and working with objects was a little challenging.
